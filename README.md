# Mini-App: Tic Tac Toe

## Overview
This was originally the first challenge in a sprint called Mini-Apps. Upon completion of the initial requirements, I enjoyed it so much that I took it upon myself to make my own copy of the repo and continue working on it my free time.

## To check out this project either:

# Visit https://jcost-tictactoe.herokuapp.com/
# OR
# Start by forking and cloning the repo into your computer in the terminal:

EX: `$ git clone https://github.com/costjonah/tictactoe_mini.git`

## Notable Functionality
Implemented single-player functionality by engineering a bot that if there are no winning moves for the user, makes a random selection, and if the user does have a winning move to make, the bot anticipates and makes that move before the user.

## Further Functionality Coming Soon
· Bot will not only block user's winning move but bot will take it's own winning move if one is available
· Ability to choose playing dual-player locally or against the bot
